<h1> Exploring-LA-Traffic-Fatalities-Attributes </h1>

<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is to analyze the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS) 2009-2013 dataset, a dataset of traffic collisions in the jurisdiction of the City of Los Angeles during 2009-2013, to identify a key insight or discovery. We conduct analysis based on relationships of three entities: collision, party, and victim.

 The <a href="https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/ladot::collisions-2009-2013-switrs?geometry=-130.525%2C-12.366%2C11.858%2C43.974">Collision tables</a> contain information on each collision, one line per collision.
<br>
  <br>
 The <a href="https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/ladot::party-tables-collisions-2009-2013-switrs/geoservice">Party tables</a> contain information from all parties involved in the collisions, one line per party. Parties are the major players in traffic collision - drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and parked vehicles. 
  <br>
  <br>
The <a href="https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/ladot::victim-tables-collisions-2009-2013-switrs"> Victim tables</a> contain information about the victims - persons associated with each party.
  <br>

  More information on the relational structure of the data and variables can be found in the dataset's <a href="https://tims.berkeley.edu/help/SWITRS.php#Collision_Level">codebook</a>.
